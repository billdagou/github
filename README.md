# TYPO3 Extension: Github

The EXT:github extension can save your time when some event is triggered in your GitHub repository with the Webhooks feature.

### Why This

Generally, you can run `git pull` to update the extensions cloned from GitHub. Supposing you have lots of websites/projects which are using the same extensions/repositories in different servers, you have to upgrade all of them one by one, which is quite time-consuming.

With this extension, all you need is to set up the webhooks in your repository settings.
